I've code in rust and i enjoy the algebraic data type that rust have. There's no null, i don't need to try catch, there's syntax for early return. But as much as i love rust, it's a hard language to learn. You need to understand borrow checker use arc mutex to share database connection between async. Right now, there are not a lot of job out there that use rust. Especially for web development.

### Why don't use golang?

Right now, golang jobs out there have increase a lot in devops space and also in web development space. Golagn is really simple, i bet it'll take you less than 1 week to get productive in it. Golang also use garbage collector and i don't need to think about borrow checker rule. **_But..._** golang don't have strong type system. It have null as a value, don't have algebraic data type and don't have option and result. This might look like i'm being petty but trust me. Debugging null pointer in golang is not fun if you have recursive data structure (taken from real life experience).

### Can't we make it better?

Before go 1.18, this problem have a hard solution. Since golang don't have generic, we couldn't make a generic container that could accept any type. We could use `interface{}` or reflection, but we'll loose the strict type and incur runtime performance penalty.

But fear no more. In golang 1.18, they introduce generic. Horray ðŸŽ‰. Now we could make a simple container that could accept generic type.

### let's add option and result to golang

now, we could make a simple struct for the option like this

```go
type Option[T any] struct {
    value T
    isSome bool
}
```

and we could make one for result like this

```go
type Result[T any] struct {
    value T
    err error
    isErr bool
}
```

after that we just need to implement map, getter, unwrap, and constructor right? well... yeah but that's tedious and thankfully there's already a good golang package called [`samber/mo`](https://github.com/samber/mo) that already implement most of the stuff that we need.

Now let's try to make a simple http server.

### example http server without monad

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware"
	"github.com/jellydator/validation"
	"github.com/jellydator/validation/is"
	_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
)

type User struct {
	Name     string `json:"name"`
	Email    string `json:"email"`
	Password string `json:"password"`
}

func (u User) Validate() error {
	return validation.ValidateStruct(&u,
		validation.Field(&u.Name, validation.Required, validation.Length(1, 255)),
		validation.Field(&u.Email, validation.Required, is.Email),
		validation.Field(&u.Password, validation.Required, validation.Length(8, 255)),
	)
}

var db *sql.DB

func init() {
	var err error
	db, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "./user.db")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	const create string = `
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
		id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
		name TEXT,
		email TEXT,
		password TEXT
  );`
	if _, err := db.Exec(create); err != nil {
		panic(err)
  }
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("starting server in port 3000 ")

	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Use(middleware.Logger)
	r.Post("/", handler)

	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var user User
	err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&user)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}
	if err := user.Validate(); err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	_, err = db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", user.Name, user.Email, user.Password)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	w.Write([]byte("success"))
}
```

this is a basic golang http server that do migration on start and server post request and add it to database. As you can see, golang need to check on the error, and if it's error then we need to early return it. If we don't check the error, the value of `user` will be `nil`.

now, let's try with result and option

### example http server with monad

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5/middleware"
	"github.com/jellydator/validation"
	"github.com/jellydator/validation/is"
	_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
	. "github.com/samber/mo"
)

type User struct {
	Name     string `json:"name"`
	Email    string `json:"email"`
	Password string `json:"password"`
}

func (u User) Validate() error {
	return validation.ValidateStruct(&u,
		validation.Field(&u.Name, validation.Required, validation.Length(1, 255)),
		validation.Field(&u.Email, validation.Required, is.Email),
		validation.Field(&u.Password, validation.Required, validation.Length(8, 255)),
	)
}

var db *sql.DB

func init() {
	const create string = `
 CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
		id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
		name TEXT,
		email TEXT,
		password TEXT
 );`

	db = TupleToResult(sql.Open("sqlite3", "./user.db")).
		Map(func(db *sql.DB) (*sql.DB, error) {
			_, err := db.Exec(create)
			return db, err
		}).
		MapErr(func(err error) (*sql.DB, error) {
			panic(err)
		}).MustGet()
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("starting server in port 3000 ")

	r := chi.NewRouter()
	r.Use(middleware.Logger)
	r.Post("/", handler)

	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", r)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	user := Try(func() (Option[User], error) {
		var user User
		err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&user)
		return Some(user), err
	}).Map(func(user Option[User]) (Option[User], error) {
		return user, user.MustGet().Validate()
	})

	if user.IsError() {
		http.Error(w, user.Error().Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	user.Map(func(user Option[User]) (Option[User], error) {
		u := user.MustGet()
		_, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", u.Name, u.Email, u.Password)
		return user, err
	}).Match(
		func(user Option[User]) (Option[User], error) {
			w.Write([]byte("success"))
			return user, nil
		},
		func(err error) (Option[User], error) {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return None[User](), err
		},
	)
}
```

at a first glance, this look much more clutered. The reason why becasuse golang right now doesn't have light weight anonymous function declaration. There's an [ongoing proposal](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21498) for it. But it looks like it won't be approved anytime soon.

Ignoring the extra mess that unnedded type in anonymous function give, this flow is much nicer than the non monad version. The `user` variable is parsed from json and it could error out. After that we want to validate it. Since we use option and `Map` function, the validation only run if user option is not empty. This way we don't need to error check if the decoding failed or not. Now, the reason why i check `if user.IsError()` is because i want to return with http.StatusBadRequest. On next iteration on this blog, we'll explore the idea of using Enum, or in mo package called Either. But for this demonstration, we will just error check it.

At the end of the function, we just match if the user have error out or not. If it error out then we write the http response with `internal server error` and if it's successful then we write with success. This way we can code the happy path first and we deal with the error out later.

### it's ugly but hey it have nicer flow

Of course this is much worst developer experience compared to rust where they have native support for this. It also look ugly compared to just error checking. But i would argue that this is a much nicer flow compared to checking `nil` and `err` every time.
